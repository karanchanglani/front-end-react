The Second Part of the Project is to basically utilize the endpoint that we have created in part one of our project using Spring Boot. We use the React Fetch Call to Fetch data from our endpoint to initialize to variables in our state which is the x and y coordinates since those are essential for creating a graph. The first thing we do is create a component I called it Stock and this is where we fetch our data from and render our plot using Plotly.js. After fetching our data we manipulate the state to contain the values that we fetched into our x and y coordinates. After that we use Plotify.js to generate our graph and render it to our screen.
